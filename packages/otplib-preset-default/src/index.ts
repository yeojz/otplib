/**
 * otplib-preset-default
 *
 * Provides fully initialised classes that are targeted

 * quickly.
 *
 * If you want to use your own Base32 and/or crypto plugin, it
 * would be better to create a new file in your project and initialise
 * the core classes manually.
 *
 * Uses:
 *
 * - Base32: 'plugin-thirty-two'
 * - Crypto: 'plugin-crypto'
